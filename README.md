# NortheasternCapstoneProject


Problem Description: Asthma is a condition that causes difficulty to breathe by factors that cause airway inflammation and swelling. The goal of this project is to research about the factors that can cause these exacerbations, collate the required data, and build a Machine learning model with a good accuracy, precision, and recall. The tools that we will be using for this project are Synthea database, excel, tableau and python notebook. 	

Purpose: Build a prototype Machine Learning model using synthetic data to predict if a certain pollen count can potentially cause allergy-based exacerbations.

Approach: 
1.	Curate a synthetic dataset, using Synthea, random simulations and pollen count trend from different pollen data provider (API). 
2.	Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the patterns in the curated data. 
3.	Fit classification models to determine the best model to use and achieve a better predictive accuracy.
